What is 30 Days of Code?
Join thousands of other hackers as they solve daily challenges for 30 days. This is great for beginners or coders who want to refresh their fundamentals. Each day, we will post a new challenge and a corresponding video tutorial (http://bit.ly/1NbxNzV) from fellow coder Kathryn Hodge. The tutorial is based on Java, but you can also choose other popular languages to submit your solution. 

Unlike most HackerRank contests, this challenge is solely to compete with and challenge yourself---not other hackers. Topics include if-else statements, recursion, data structures, object-oriented programming, running time, and testing! 

So what are you waiting for? Join the 30 Days of Code challenge now!
